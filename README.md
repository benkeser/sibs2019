# SIBS 2019 Intro to ML Materials

**Authors:** [David Benkeser](https://www.github.com/benkeser/)

## Description

`sibs2019` contains all code used to create the Docker image and 
run basic machine learning analyses on real and simulated data. 

-----

## Usage

This GitHub repository contains the source code needed to build the
docker image that was used in class. The built image is also available on
[DockerHub]
(https://cloud.docker.com/u/dbenkeser/repository/docker/dbenkeser/sibs2019).
The `R` code can be found in the `/R` directory, while `.RData` files are in
the `/data` directory. 

To run the docker image on a local machine (i.e., to obtain the same R Studio
environment that was demonstrated in class), you need to [download docker]
(https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) to your local machine. 

From the command line you would execute the command.

``` bash
docker run -e PASSWORD=sosecret! -p 8787:8787 -d dbenkeser/sibs2019:latest
```

Then open a browser window and navigate to `localhost:8787`, where you will be
prompted to login to R Studio using the `PASSWORD` created above (user is
`rstudio`). 

In the container relevant `R` scripts can be found in `/home/lib` and relevant
data in `/home/data`. The "secret" outcomes data are in `/home/secret`.

## Issues

If you encounter any bugs or can't remember how to run the container you can
[file an issue](https://github.com/benkeser/sibs2019/issues).
